- **Deployed**: All changes pushed to GitHub main branch (commit 09ee516)

## ‚úÖ CONFIRMED - Linux Server Configuration Working
### Server Details Confirmed
- **FTP Images Path**: `/srv/camera_uploads/camera001/192.168.1.54/2025-09-25/Common`
- **UDP Port**: 17081 (confirmed working with `nc -u -l -p 17081`)

## üö® NEW ISSUE - Dashboard Not Accessible on Linux Server
### Problem
- User reports dashboard not opening at `http://localhost:3001/dashboard` on Linux server
- Need to investigate server configuration and routing

### Investigation Plan
- [x] Check if server is running on correct port (3001 vs 3000)
- [x] Verify dashboard route exists in server configuration
- [x] Check if frontend dashboard files are included in backend
- [x] Investigate if dashboard is separate frontend application

### Solution Implemented ‚úÖ
- **Root Cause**: Backend was pure API without dashboard frontend
- **Port Issue**: Server runs on port 3000, not 3001
- **Solution**: Created complete web dashboard with API integration

### Dashboard Features Created
- [x] Real-time server status monitoring
- [x] System statistics display
- [x] Radar status overview
- [x] Recent fines display
- [x] External services management (FTP/UDP)
- [x] API endpoint testing interface
- [x] User authentication integration
- [x] Responsive modern UI design

### Access Instructions
- **Correct URL**: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` (NOT 3001)
- **Root redirect**: `http://localhost:3000/` ‚Üí automatically redirects to dashboard
- **Login**: Use admin@potasfactory.com / admin123 for full functionality

## üö® NEW ISSUE - Login Not Working
### Problem
- User reports login functionality not working in dashboard
- Need to investigate authentication system and user seeding

### Investigation Results ‚úÖ
- **API Test**: Login endpoint works perfectly - returns JWT token
- **Credentials Confirmed**: admin@potasfactory.com / admin123 ‚úÖ Working
- **Database**: User seeded correctly with ID 6
- **Issue**: Likely frontend JavaScript or CORS problem in dashboard

### Solution
- Dashboard JavaScript may need debugging
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify CORS headers for dashboard requests

## Lessons Learned
- **Database Design**: Proper indexing is crucial for performance with large datasets
- **Report Generation**: Async processing is essential for complex report generation
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging helps with compliance and debugging
- **Demo Data**: Realistic test data significantly improves testing quality
- **API Documentation**: Detailed documentation with examples improves developer experience
- **Database Compatibility**: When switching from MySQL to SQLite, need to update SQL functions (HOUR() ‚Üí strftime('%H'))
- **Environment Variables**: Always provide fallbacks for critical environment variables like JWT_SECRET
